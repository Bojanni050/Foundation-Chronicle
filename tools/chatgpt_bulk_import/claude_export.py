"""
Imports conversations from Anthropic's official Claude data export
(claude.ai -> Settings -> Privacy -> Export data) into Chronicle.

Unlike chatgpt_provider.py / gemini_provider.py, this never touches a
browser: the export already contains every conversation as structured JSON,
so this just reads conversations.json (from a .zip or an already-extracted
folder) and POSTs each one to /api/objects/import — same endpoint, same
dedup contract, as the browser-driven importers.

Usage (called from bulk_import.py, not run directly):
